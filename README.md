# javascript-challenge

### Project Set Up

1. Created a new repository for this project called `javascript-challenge`. 

2. Cloned the new repository to my computer.

3. Inside my local git repository, I created a directory for the Javascript challenge, using the folder names to correspond to the challenges: **UFO-level-1** and **UFO-level-2**.

4. Added my **html** files to this folder as well as my static folder containing my javascript. This was the main script to run for analysis.

5. Pushed the above changes to GitHub.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Used the StarterCode/index.html file.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* My web page had a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple (Two) Search Categories 

* In addtion to all of Level 1 criteria, I added a city form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` and the city column to find rows that match user input.  The JavaScript code allows the user to select either Date or City or Both.  


### Level 3: Multiple Search (Three) Categories 

* In addtion to all of Level 2 criteria, I added a shape form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time`, the city and the shape columns to find rows that match user input.  The JavaScript code allows the user to select either Date or City or or Shape as well as any combination of these options.  NOTE: this can be easily tested using dates - 1/1/2010, 1/2/2010 and 1/3/2010; cities  - benton, bonita and el cajon; and shapes circle and triangle - I added test data to the data set to easily verify that the JavaScript code is working.  All test data is described as "Test Data" in the comments column so that it can be easily identified and removed.  


### Level 3.5: Multiple Search (Three) Categories Plus added Selection Dropdown Boxes

* In addtion to all of Level 3 criteria, I changed date, city and shape forms to select dropdown forms.  This level is a preliminary level to level 4.  For this level, I hard coded the selection options into the HTML and provided only 3 options for each form.  

### Level 4.0: Multiple Search (Three) Categories Plus added Selection Dropdown Boxes Plus Used the Data from the Data.JS to Populate the Selection Forms

* In addtion to all of Level 3.5 criteria, I added JavaScript code to populate the web page dropdown selection forms with data for data.js.
